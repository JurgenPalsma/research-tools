abstract = "Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) are stochastic search methods that mimic the natural biological evolution and/or the social behavior of species. Such algorithms have been developed to arrive at near-optimum solutions to large-scale optimization problems, for which traditional mathematical techniques may fail. This paper compares the formulation and results of five recent evolutionary-based algorithms: genetic algorithms, memetic algorithms, particle swarm, ant-colony systems, and shuffled frog leaping. A brief description of each algorithm is presented along with a pseudocode to facilitate the implementation and use of such algorithms by researchers and practitioners. Benchmark comparisons among the algorithms are presented for both continuous and discrete optimization problems, in terms of processing time, convergence speed, and quality of the results. Based on this comparative analysis, the performance of EAs is discussed along with some guidelines for determining the best operators for each algorithm. The study presents sophisticated ideas in a simplified form that should be beneficial to both practitioners and researchers involved in solving optimization problems."

abstract="This paper presents stylized facts concerning the spot intra-daily foreign exchange markets. It first describes intra-daily data and proposes a set of definitions for the variables of interest. Empirical regularities of the foreign exchange intra-daily data are then grouped under three major topics: the distribution of price changes, the process of price formation and the heterogeneous structure of the market. The stylized facts surveyed in this paper shed new light on the market structure that appears composed of heterogeneous  agents. It also poses several challenges such as the definition of price and of the time-scale, the concepts of risk and efficiency, the modeling of the markets and the learning process.",

abstract="The majority of forecasting tools use a physical time scale for studying price fluctuations of financial markets, making the flow of physical time discontinuous. Therefore, using a physical time scale may expose companies to risks, due to ignorance of some significant activities. In this paper, an alternative and novel approach is explored to capture important activities in the market. The main idea is to use an intrinsic time scale based on Directional Changes. Combined with Genetic Programming, the proposed approach aims to find an optimal trading strategy to forecast the future price moves of a financial market. In order to evaluate its efficiency and robustness as forecasting tool, a series of experiments was performed, where we were able to obtain valuable information about the forecasting performance. The results from the experiments indicate that this new framework is able to generate new and profitable trading strategies.",

abstract="Prices in financial markets are normally summarized by time series, where transaction prices are sampled at fixed time intervals. Directional change is an alternative way of sampling data: transaction price is sampled when a significant change in the price is recorded. In this paper, we explain how directional changes can provide a valuable alternative perspective to price movements. We also describe the frontier of directional change research, which include forecasting, algorithmic trading and market tracking.",

    abstract = { Shuffled Frog Leaping Algorithm (SFLA) is a meta-heuristic for solving discrete optimization problems. Here it is applied to determine optimal discrete pipe sizes for new pipe networks and for network expansions. SFLA is a population based, cooperative search metaphor inspired by natural memetics. The algorithm uses memetic evolution in the form of infection of ideas from one individual to another in a local search. The local search is similar in concept to particle swarm optimization. A shuffling strategy allows for the exchange of information between local searches to move toward a global optimum. This paper summarizes the development of SFLANET, a computer model that links SFLA and the hydraulic simulation software EPANET and its library functions. Application of SFLANET to literature network design problems is then described. Although the algorithm is in its initial stages of development, promising results were obtained.  }
